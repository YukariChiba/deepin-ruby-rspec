This package is maintained in a Git repository on Alioth.

It uses the Debian 3.0 (quilt) source format, with a single tarball.

The upstream version has the following form: x.y.0c1e2m3s4-z
x.y corresponds to the major/minor version of rspec.
first number after x.y (0 in the example):
  the number of the revision for rspec gem 
number after c: revision for rspec-core
number after e: revision for rspec-expectations
number after m: revision for rspec-mocks
number after s: revision for rspec-support


The workflow for the moment is the following:


detect a new upstream version
-----------------------------

No automatic centralized debian/watch (yet).
use ./debian/rules report


update to a new upstream version
--------------------------------

use the following targets from debian/rules to create the unified upstream
tarball:

- debian/rules get-orig-sources: 
    download the several upstream tarballs
- debian/rules repack-sources:
    creates the unified tarball from the downloaded ones

Then use `gbp import-orig` as you normally would.

Then do:

- quilt push

  will push the first patch, which modifies the gemspecs

- unapply it manually

  `patch -R -p1 < debian/patches/gemspecs.patch`

- debian/rules gen-gemspecs:
    interpret upstream 'source' gemspec to real ones, with shell commands
    (calls to git), and store replace the original ones

- quilt refresh

- then continue with `quilt push`, hack, `quilt refresh`, etc, until all the
  patchs are refreshed.
